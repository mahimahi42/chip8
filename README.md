# CHIP-8 Emulator in Rust
## Or: How I Did It Yet Again And Learned To Love Rust

---

A CHIP-8 emulator in Rust to begin to learn the language. It's rough.

Starr Horne's version was heavily used as a reference and guide, with code borrowed to learn Rust and to fix bugs in instruction implementation. It can be [found here](https://github.com/starrhorne/chip8-rust).
